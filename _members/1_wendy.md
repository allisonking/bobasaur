description: Wendy's dream since college has been to start her own boba store, and Bobasaur is the culmination of that dream after years of hard work and research. She has traveled all throughout the world to determine the answer to the question-- what makes a good, comforting, drink? Wendy is an expert in psychology and in the way humans interact with one another. Her friends can attest to her skills in caring and thoughtfulness, resulting in the one of a kind environment you will find at Bobasaur. Her boba of choice is taro milk tea with less sugar.
