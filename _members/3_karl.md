description: Karl spent much of his young adult life impressing his friends with his well stocked kitchen. In college, he was Wendy and Allison's Fashion Advisor (FA). Frequently, throughout the semester, one could hear the small yelps of 'FA!' coming from Wendy or Allison's room, seeking fashion advice. His love for cooking has created a loving menu for Bobasaur. His boba of choice is a mango slush, no matter the season.
