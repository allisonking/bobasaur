description: Allison is a boba enthusiast, which she attributes to her Taiwanese roots, or just common sense. Before she quit her job to help out her buddy to start Bobasaur, she was a software engineer. Her dream for Bobasaur is to establish a nice local place to share bits and pieces of Asian and Asian American culture. Her boba of choice is oolong milk tea, light sugar, light ice, and depending on the establishment, light boba.
