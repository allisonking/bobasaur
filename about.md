Bobasaur is an aspiring boba store in the Boston area, serving up fresh, thirst quenching drinks to eager locals. The idea for Bobasaur was originally conceived in a dorm room of a boba tea starved campus by our founder Wendy Xu. She knocked on the doors of her two neighbors, Karl and Allison, and declared that there needed to exist a friendly, yummy, safe place to delight in boba, conversation, and culture.
